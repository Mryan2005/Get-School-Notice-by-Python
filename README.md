## Why I create this project?

When I found out I had to finish the Second Classroom, I thought it would be very crazy, so I decided to develop this
project to finish the Second Classroom. In my mind, it can gather information about my school-- because I want to let it
solve the problem of my school, and some day I will let it be able to be used in every area. I think it will be very
interesting.
